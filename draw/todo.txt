Changing draw.io configuration
Method 1 (Build you custom image with setting pre-loaded)

    Edit PreConfig.js & PostConfig.js files (next to Dockerfile in debian or alpine folders)
    Build the docker image

Method 2 (Using existing running docker container)

    Edit PreConfig.js & PostConfig.js files (next to Dockerfile in debian or alpine folders)
    Copy these files to docker container

docker cp PreConfig.js draw:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/draw/js/
docker cp PostConfig.js draw:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/draw/js/

Method 3 (Bind configuration files into the container when started)

    This method allows changing the configuration files directly on the host without invoking any other docker commands. It can be used for testing
    Edit PreConfig.js & PostConfig.js files (next to Dockerfile in debian or alpine folders)
    From within the directory that contained the configuration files, run the following command to start docker container
    Note: self-contained docker-compose file already mount the configuration files into the container
